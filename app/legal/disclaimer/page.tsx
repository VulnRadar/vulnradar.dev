      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mt-8">2. Not Professional Security Advice</h2>
      <p className="leading-relaxed text-foreground/90">
        VulnRadar scan results and remediation guidance do <strong>NOT</strong> constitute

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mt-8">3. Accuracy of Results</h2>
      <p className="leading-relaxed text-foreground/90">
        VulnRadar performs 65+ automated vulnerability checks based on publicly observable
        information (HTTP headers, HTML content, SSL/TLS configuration, JavaScript analysis,
        and more). Results may include:
      </p>
      <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 text-foreground/90">
        <li><strong>False positives</strong>: issues flagged that are not actual vulnerabilities in your specific context.</li>
        <li><strong>False negatives</strong>: real vulnerabilities that the scanner does not detect.</li>
        <li><strong>Incomplete coverage</strong>: the scanner checks a specific set of known issues and does not cover all possible vulnerability classes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mt-8">4. Your Responsibility</h2>
      <p className="leading-relaxed text-foreground/90">

        <li>Verifying scan results before taking any action.</li>
        <li>Any consequences resulting from scanning a website, whether authorized or unauthorized.</li>
        <li>Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>Any damages to systems or data that may result from actions taken based on scan results.</li>
