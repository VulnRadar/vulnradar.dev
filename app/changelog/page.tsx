      { icon: BadgeCheck, label: "Embeddable Security Badge", desc: "Site owners can now embed a 'Secured by VulnRadar' badge on their website. The badge dynamically renders as an SVG showing Safe/Caution/Unsafe status with the last scan date, linking back to the shared report. Grab the HTML or Markdown snippet from the new Badge page." },
      { icon: Globe, label: "Subdomain & Asset Discovery", desc: "After scanning a domain, VulnRadar now discovers subdomains via Certificate Transparency logs (crt.sh) and common prefix probing (www, api, admin, staging, dev, mail, etc.). Each discovered subdomain shows reachability status and can be scanned with one click." },
      { icon: Fingerprint, label: "60+ Secret Detection Patterns", desc: "Massively expanded the hardcoded secrets detector from 7 to 60+ patterns. Now catches AWS, Azure, GCP, Stripe, PayPal, OpenAI, Anthropic, GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Discord, Twilio, SendGrid, MongoDB URIs, PostgreSQL URIs, JWT tokens, SSH/RSA/PGP private keys, and generic API key/password assignments. Each match shows a partially redacted value as proof." },
      { icon: Eye, label: "Live Scan Evidence", desc: "All vulnerability findings now show actual content extracted from the live page instead of generic descriptions. Mixed-content violations list the real HTTP URLs found, SRI-missing checks show the exact script sources, and sensitive comments display the matched comment text." },
      { icon: Shield, label: "Response Header Inspector", desc: "Scan results now include a collapsible Response Headers panel showing the raw HTTP headers returned by the target site, with badges highlighting which security headers are present or missing." },

All alerts (backup code warnings, version updates, Discord announcements) now appear in a stacked card UI with dot navigation and a 1/3 counter, showing the most important notifications first." },
      { icon: List, label: "Audit Log & Staff Pagination", desc: "The admin panel's Audit Log and Staff tabs now paginate at 5 items per page with the same PaginationControl component used elsewhere. Audit log pagination is server-side for performance, while staff uses client-side pagination." },
      { icon: ChevronRight, label: "Instant Admin Button", desc: "The Admin tab in the navbar no longer flickers on page navigation. The user's role is cached in sessionStorage so the button renders immediately without waiting for the API response." },

      { icon: Key, label: "Hashed Backup Codes", desc: "2FA backup codes are now hashed using scrypt (same as passwords) instead of stored in plaintext. Existing users with old codes see a warning dialog prompting them to regenerate immediately." },

Expanded from 75 to ${TOTAL_CHECKS_LABEL} checks covering headers, SSL, content, cookies, configuration, and information disclosure.` },
      { icon: ShieldCheck, label: "Smart Safety Rating Engine", desc: "Rebuilt the safety rating from scratch with a three-tier classification system. Tier 1 (Exploitable) covers real threats like SQL injection, XSS, and exposed credentials. Tier 2 (Hardening) covers missing headers and best practices. Tier 3 (Informational) is excluded entirely. Sites like Discord and Reddit now correctly show as 'Safe' instead of being falsely flagged for missing optional headers." },
      { icon: Target, label: "Framework-Aware Detection", desc: "The scanner now detects Next.js, Nuxt, and Angular and adjusts severity accordingly. CSP directives like unsafe-inline in style-src are marked as INFO on framework sites instead of HIGH, eliminating false positives. A dedicated framework-required CSP check explains which directives are expected for the detected framework." },
      { icon: List, label: "Pagination Everywhere", desc: "Added pagination across the app using a reusable PaginationControl component. History page shows 10 scans per page, admin panel shows 5 users per page, and team scan history is paginated at 10 per page. All with smooth transitions instead of full-page reloads." },
      { icon: Search, label: "Server-Side Admin Search", desc: "Admin user search now queries the database directly with ILIKE filtering across all users, not just the current page. Results update live with a 300ms debounce and smooth opacity transitions -- no page flicker." },
      { icon: Shield, label: "Security Header Fixes", desc: "Fixed CSP trailing semicolon that caused Vercel to strip frame-ancestors directive. Verified X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy headers are properly served in production using debug header analysis." },
      { icon: Zap, label: "Centralized Constants System", desc: "All environment variables (database, SMTP, Turnstile, contact email) are now managed through a centralized constants file with proper validation, replacing scattered process.env calls throughout the codebase." },
      { icon: RefreshCw, label: "Smooth Admin Pagination", desc: "Admin panel pagination and audit log paging no longer trigger full-page skeleton reloads. Only the table content dims briefly with a smooth opacity transition while new data loads in the background." },

      { icon: AlertTriangle, label: "Stricter Detection Logic", desc: "Dramatically reduced false positives across all checks. Mixed content detection now filters localhost and examples. Email exposure requires 2+ addresses. Open redirect detection identifies actual vulnerable patterns, not just parameter names." },
      { icon: Search, label: "Enhanced Pattern Matching", desc: "Improved detection of SQL errors (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, SQLite), command execution (Node.js, Python, Java), and framework-specific patterns. All checks now filter documentation and placeholder code." },

These are now marked as 'info' level instead of 'high'." },
      { icon: ShieldCheck, label: "Intelligent Safety Rating", desc: "Safety rating now considers actual security threats rather than just counting severity levels. Framework-required directives don't count against the safety score. Sites need multiple high-severity issues or critical vulnerabilities to be marked 'unsafe'." },
