const CHANGELOG = [
  {
    version: "1.2.0",
    date: "February 9, 2026",
    title: "Comprehensive Security Check Expansion",
    highlights: true,
    changes: [
      { icon: Shield, label: "10 New Critical Security Checks", desc: "Added detection for SQL injection patterns, command injection, XXE vulnerabilities, SSRF, path traversal, insecure authentication, deserialization flaws, missing rate limiting, GraphQL introspection, and clickjacking protection gaps." },
      { icon: AlertTriangle, label: "Stricter Detection Logic", desc: "Dramatically reduced false positives across all checks. Mixed content detection now filters localhost and examples. Email exposure requires 2+ addresses. Open redirect detection identifies actual vulnerable patterns, not just parameter names." },
      { icon: Search, label: "Enhanced Pattern Matching", desc: "Improved detection of SQL errors (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, SQLite), command execution (Node.js, Python, Java), and framework-specific patterns. All checks now filter documentation and placeholder code." },
      { icon: Target, label: "Context-Aware Filtering", desc: "Every check now excludes common false positives: example.com, localhost, placeholder text, HTML comments, and documentation code. Minimum thresholds prevent single-occurrence noise." },
      { icon: Brain, label: "Smarter Vulnerability Assessment", desc: "New checks identify actual exploitable vulnerabilities (SQL errors visible, insecure auth mechanisms, missing cookie flags) rather than theoretical risks. Focus on real-world attack vectors." },
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.1.4",
    date: "February 9, 2026",
    title: "Smart Security Analysis",
    highlights: false,
    changes: [
      { icon: Brain, label: "Framework-Aware Scanning", desc: "Scanner now detects Next.js, React, Vue, and Angular frameworks and recognizes when 'unsafe-inline' or 'unsafe-eval' CSP directives are framework requirements rather than security vulnerabilities. These are now marked as 'info' level instead of 'high'." },
      { icon: ShieldCheck, label: "Intelligent Safety Rating", desc: "Safety rating now considers actual security threats rather than just counting severity levels. Framework-required directives don't count against the safety score. Sites need multiple high-severity issues or critical vulnerabilities to be marked 'unsafe'." },
      { icon: Target, label: "Context-Aware Analysis", desc: "Improved threat assessment logic that distinguishes between necessary framework trade-offs and actual exploitable vulnerabilities, providing more accurate security assessments for modern web applications." },
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.1.3",
    date: "February 9, 2026",
    title: "Scanner Accuracy Improvements",
    highlights: false,
    changes: [
      { icon: Target, label: "Reduced False Positives", desc: "Improved prototype pollution detection to focus on actual vulnerable library functions (Lodash, jQuery) rather than flagging legitimate framework code patterns." },
      { icon: Shield, label: "Better Threat Detection", desc: "Enhanced scanning logic now distinguishes between potentially dangerous code patterns and safe framework implementations, providing more accurate security assessments." },
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.1.2",
    date: "February 9, 2026",
    title: "Safety Rating Indicator",
    highlights: false,
    changes: [
      { icon: ShieldCheck, label: "Website Safety Rating", desc: "Scan reports now prominently display a safety indicator (Safe to View / View with Caution / Not Safe to View) based on vulnerability severity. This helps non-technical users quickly understand if a website is safe to browse." },
      { icon: Eye, label: "PDF Report Safety Rating", desc: "Exported PDF reports now include the safety rating section, making it easy to share security assessments with clients and stakeholders." },
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.1.1",
    date: "February 9, 2026",
    title: "Metadata & Branding Polish",
    highlights: false,
    changes: [
      { icon: Sparkles, label: "Consistent Social Cards", desc: "All pages now display unified OpenGraph metadata with consistent VulnRadar branding when shared on Discord, Twitter, or other social platforms." },
      { icon: Eye, label: "Unified Page Titles", desc: "Browser tabs now show 'VulnRadar' consistently across all pages for cleaner branding and better recognition." },
      { icon: Shield, label: "Enhanced Security Headers", desc: "Improved Content Security Policy configuration to allow Cloudflare Turnstile while maintaining strong security protections." },
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.1.0",
    date: "February 9, 2026",
    title: "Contact System & UI Enhancements",
    highlights: false,
    changes: [
      { icon: MessageSquare, label: "Enhanced Contact Form", desc: "Redesigned contact page with category selection (Bug Report, Feature Request, Security Issue, General Help) and instant email delivery without blocking the UI." },
      { icon: Shield, label: "CAPTCHA Protection", desc: "Integrated Cloudflare Turnstile to prevent spam and bot submissions on the contact form while maintaining a seamless user experience." },
      { icon: Users, label: "Team Collaboration", desc: "Team members can now view each other's scan history and full scan details for better collaboration. Click 'View Scans' next to any team member to see their complete vulnerability scan history and detailed results." },
      { icon: Users, label: "Team Invite Emails", desc: "Team invitations are now sent via email with secure invite links. Invited members receive professional branded emails with team details and one-click acceptance." },
      { icon: Sparkles, label: "Professional Email Templates", desc: "Beautiful dark-themed email templates with gradient accents for contact confirmations, password resets, and team invitations." },
      { icon: Zap, label: "Instant Response Times", desc: "Contact form submissions and password reset requests now respond immediately while emails are sent in the background, dramatically improving user experience." },
      { icon: Lock, label: "Smart Email Routing", desc: "Contact emails route with proper Reply-To headers and automatic user confirmations for every submission." },
      { icon: Eye, label: "Improved Scanner UI", desc: "Added 'Scan Another URL' button above results for easier navigation and better user flow." },
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.0.0",

      { icon: Users, label: "User Accounts & Auth", desc: "Full authentication system with sign up, login, profile management, two-factor authentication (TOTP), backup codes, and secure password reset." },
      { icon: Lock, label: "Admin Dashboard", desc: "Admin panel with user management, audit logs, session tracking, and the ability to revoke sessions or API keys." },
      { icon: Zap, label: "Webhooks & Notifications", desc: "Discord, Slack, and generic webhook integrations. Get notified automatically when scans complete." },
      { icon: RefreshCw, label: "Scheduled & Bulk Scanning", desc: "Set up recurring scans on daily, weekly, or monthly intervals. Scan up to 10 URLs at once with bulk scanning." },
      { icon: Eye, label: "Scan Comparison & Sharing", desc: "Side-by-side comparison of scan results over time. Generate shareable links for client reports." },
      { icon: Tag, label: "Scan Tags & History", desc: "Full scan history with search, filtering, and custom tags. Organize scans by project, environment, or client." },
      { icon: List, label: "PDF Export", desc: "Export scan results as professional PDF reports ready for stakeholders." },
      { icon: Users, label: "Teams & Organizations", desc: "Create teams, invite members with role-based access (owner/admin/viewer), and collaborate on security scans." },
      { icon: Gauge, label: "API Keys & Rate Limiting", desc: "Generate API keys for programmatic scanning with built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse." },
