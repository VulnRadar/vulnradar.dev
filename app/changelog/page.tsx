      { icon: AlertTriangle, label: "Stricter Detection Logic", desc: "Dramatically reduced false positives across all checks. Mixed content detection now filters localhost and examples. Email exposure requires 2+ addresses. Open redirect detection identifies actual vulnerable patterns, not just parameter names." },

      { icon: Brain, label: "Framework-Aware Scanning", desc: "Scanner now detects Next.js, React, Vue, and Angular frameworks and recognizes when 'unsafe-inline' or 'unsafe-eval' CSP directives are framework requirements rather than security vulnerabilities. These are now marked as 'info' level instead of 'high'." },
      { icon: ShieldCheck, label: "Intelligent Safety Rating", desc: "Safety rating now considers actual security threats rather than just counting severity levels. Framework-required directives don't count against the safety score. Sites need multiple high-severity issues or critical vulnerabilities to be marked 'unsafe'." },
      { icon: Target, label: "Context-Aware Analysis", desc: "Improved threat assessment logic that distinguishes between necessary framework trade-offs and actual exploitable vulnerabilities, providing more accurate security assessments for modern web applications." },

    version: "1.1.3",
    date: "February 9, 2026",
    title: "Scanner Accuracy Improvements",
    highlights: false,
    changes: [
      { icon: Target, label: "Reduced False Positives", desc: "Improved prototype pollution detection to focus on actual vulnerable library functions (Lodash, jQuery) rather than flagging legitimate framework code patterns." },
      { icon: Shield, label: "Better Threat Detection", desc: "Enhanced scanning logic now distinguishes between potentially dangerous code patterns and safe framework implementations, providing more accurate security assessments." },
    ],

    changes: [
      { icon: ShieldCheck, label: "Website Safety Rating", desc: "Scan reports now prominently display a safety indicator (Safe to View / View with Caution / Not Safe to View) based on vulnerability severity. This helps non-technical users quickly understand if a website is safe to browse." },
      { icon: Eye, label: "PDF Report Safety Rating", desc: "Exported PDF reports now include the safety rating section, making it easy to share security assessments with clients and stakeholders." },

    version: "1.1.1",
    date: "February 9, 2026",

      { icon: Sparkles, label: "Professional Email Templates", desc: "Beautiful dark-themed email templates with gradient accents for contact confirmations, password resets, and team invitations." },
      { icon: Zap, label: "Instant Response Times", desc: "Contact form submissions and password reset requests now respond immediately while emails are sent in the background, dramatically improving user experience." },
      { icon: Lock, label: "Smart Email Routing", desc: "Contact emails route with proper Reply-To headers and automatic user confirmations for every submission." },
